# RarityPrepwork

This repository contains 10 projects completed as preperation work before starting the Advanced Solidity Bootcamp from RareSkills. Here is a comprehensive list of all of the projects:

## Blockchain and Smart Contract Projects Summary

1. **NFT Purchase with ERC20 Tokens**  
   Build a classic NFT that can be minted exclusively using a specific ERC20 token.

2. **Time Unlocked ERC20/Vesting Contract**  
   Implement a contract where a payer deposits tokens, but the receiver can only withdraw them gradually over a set number of days.

3. **NFT Swap Contract**  
   Enable two users to trade NFTs in a trustless manner using a contract that matches and swaps NFTs based on their addresses and tokenIds.

4. **Crowdfunding ERC20 Contract**  
   Create a contract with functions to initiate fundraisers and allow donations, with different outcomes based on meeting goals and deadlines.

5. **English Auction Contract**  
   Develop a contract for NFT auctions with features for depositing NFTs, bidding, and handling auctions based on reserve prices and deadlines.

6. **Simple NFT Marketplace**  
   Facilitate the sale of NFTs where sellers set prices and buyers purchase before expiration, with considerations for multiple listings of the same NFT.

7. **Stake Together**  
   Design a staking contract where users receive rewards proportional to their stake in a pool of cloud coins, with attention to potential abuses.

8. **Simple Lottery**  
   Implement a lottery system where users can purchase tickets within a time frame, and winners are determined by future blockhashes.

9. **ERC1155 Bingo**  
   Use ERC1155 tokens for a bingo game where players get randomly arranged numbers and mint new cards every few blocks to achieve bingo.

10. **On-chain Blackjack**  
    Create an open-hand blackjack game using smart contracts, with a random number generator for card values and a dealerNextMove() function for game progression.
